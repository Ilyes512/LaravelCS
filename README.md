## (The not yet Improved) Laravel Cheat Sheet

This is a Laravel 4 Cheat Sheet. It's based on the original by [JesseObrien](https://github.com/JesseObrien). I plan on making it (more) usefull and responsive by using tools like Foundation 5, Jekyll, Vaprobash, gruntJS, sass and more. This is going to be a mini-project for me. At the moment I am reading a couple of Laravel books and so I plan on adding/update as I read/learn.
