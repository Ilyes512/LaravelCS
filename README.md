## Laravel Cheat Sheet

This is a Laravel 4 Cheat Sheet. It's based on the original by [JesseObrien](https://github.com/JesseObrien). I plan on making it (more) usefull and responsive by using tools like Foundation 5, Jekyll, Vaprobash, GruntJS, Sass and more.

This is going to be a mini-project for me. At the moment I am reading a couple of Laravel books and so I plan on adding/updating as I read/learn. Your always welcome to contribute in anyway! Happy coding!
